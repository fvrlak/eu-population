# EU Population Growth Analysis (2005-2024)

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes population trends across European Union member states between 2005 and 2024. Using data from Eurostat, the analysis identifies countries that experienced significant population growth or decline over this period and visualizes these changes.

## Objective

The primary objective was to determine and visualize the **absolute population change** and the **percentage population change** for each EU country from 2005 to 2024. This helps in understanding which nations are growing and which are shrinking, and at what rate.

## Data Source

Population data for the years 2005 and 2024 was obtained from the official Eurostat database.

*   **Source Link:** [Eurostat Population Projections Database](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/population-projections/data/database)

## Methodology

The analysis involved the following steps:

1.  **Data Extraction:** Obtaining population figures for 2005 and 2024 from the Eurostat source.
2.  **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Ensuring the data was in a usable format and consistent across countries.
3.  **Calculating Changes:** Computing the absolute difference (`2024 Pop - 2005 Pop`) and the percentage change (`((2024 Pop - 2005 Pop) / 2005 Pop) * 100`) for each country.
4.  **Visualization:** Creating a table and potentially charts to display the results in a clear and easily digestible format using Tableau Public.


## Key Findings

Based on the analysis of population data for EU member states between 2005 and 2024:

*   The overall population of the European Union appears to have grown steadily over this period.
*   Countries with the **highest absolute or percentage population growth** include Luxembourg and Malta.
*   Countries experiencing the **lowest population growth or decline** include Bulgaria and Latvia.
*   A noticeable pattern is that **Post-Soviet states** tend to have lower population growth rates compared to **Western European states**.

## Analysis and Interpretation

Several factors likely contribute to the observed population trends:

*   The differing growth rates between Post-Soviet and Western European states **suggest significant migration patterns**. This could be attributed to immigration from countries like Bulgaria and Latvia towards Western European countries seeking work opportunities and better pay.
*   Countries with already large populations like France, Spain, and Germany show high absolute growth, likely due to a **continued influx of immigrants** from both within and outside the EU.
*   Smaller countries like Malta and Luxembourg may show high *percentage* growth because even a moderate increase in population represents a large percentage change from their smaller base population.
